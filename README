This is my first programming project.  I thought it would be fun and useful to have a "search engine" dedicated solely to finding jewelry that matched the user's search terms.  The results shown will be from pre-vetted sites, my favorites and my friends' favorites on the web.  For example, if the user types "turquoise earrings", they will be shown a page of earrings that have turquoise in their product description.  The earrings shown will be from the one or more of the websites I've chosen to scrape.

Regarding import settings - settings.py file is my password for mysql.  Since this repository is public, I am not including the password.
If you want to copy the code here, you can either:
1.) delete the "import settings" at the top of the files and then set the value of the passwd variable in the product_details_to_db function to your mysql password, like this: passwd = 'yourPassword'

2.) create your own settings.py file with your password.  Just type db_password = 'yourPassword'

I've included the createNewDb.txt file in this repository to show how to create mysql tables to hold the data from the sites you're scraping.
